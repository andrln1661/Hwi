    "## Project Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "To numerically model light scattering caused by micro-defects (sub-micron inclusions, voids, or microcrystallites) in high-purity amorphous silica, as used in telescope lenses and UV lithography optics, and quantify their impact on transmission efficiency, scattering losses, and wavefront quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation will:\n",
    "1. Implement **Mie scattering theory** for spherical inclusions\n",
    "2. Model **realistic defect distributions** from manufacturing processes like FHD\n",
    "3. Link microscopic defect parameteres to **macroscopic optical performance metrics** (scattering loss in db, stray light patterns, PSF broadening)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Novelty \n",
    "Instead of only using empirical scattering data, this will simulate the optical performance from first principles (electromagnetic theory).\n",
    "Will incorporate stochastic distributions of defect size, shape, and refractive index contrast, enabling realistic predictions for manufaturing tolerances\n",
    "Possible extension: combine with Monte Carlo ray tracing to simulate actual beam propogation through a defect-laden medium\n",
    "Could be the basis for inverting the model - predicting defect statistics from measured scattering patterns (non-destructive quality control).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Abstract \n",
    "High-purity amorphous silica is the material of choice for high-performance optical components in astronomy and semiconductor lithoraphy due to its exceptional transparency and low scattering in the UV-to-IR range. However, micro-defects - arising from incomplete fusion, dopant inhomogeneity, or contamination during manufacturng - can cause scattring taht limits system performance. We present a simulation framework based on Mie scattring that limits system performance. We present a simulation framework based on Mie scattering theory to model light interaction with sub-micron inclusions in amorphous silica. The model incorporates size and refractive index distributions of defects, predicts total integrated scattering, and generates angular scattering profiles. By linking defect population statistics to macroscopic scattering losses, the framework provides quantitative guidance for manufacturing quality thresholds and in-situ defect detection strategies."
